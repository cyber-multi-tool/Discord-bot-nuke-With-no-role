we'll make sure it can run continuously on Termux.

Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Install Prerequisites on Termux

First, make sure you have the required packages installed on Termux. Open Termux and run these commands:

pkg update
pkg upgrade
pkg install python
pkg install git

2. Install discord.py

Next, install the discord.py library, which allows us to interact with Discord's API:

pip install discord.py

3. Create Your Bot Application

1. Go to the Discord Developer Portal.


2. Create a new application.


3. Under the "Bot" tab, create a bot and copy the token. We will use this token in the script.



4. Write the Bot Script

Now, create a Python script in Termux for your bot:

nano bro_come_on_bot.py

Paste the following code into the file:

import discord
import asyncio

intents = discord.Intents.default()
intents.messages = True

# Create a client instance
client = discord.Client(intents=intents)

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'Bro, I\'m logged in as {client.user}')
    
    # Send a message every 5 seconds to all text channels in all guilds (servers)
    while True:
        for guild in client.guilds:
            for channel in guild.text_channels:
                try:
                    # Send message to the channel
                    await channel.send('Bro, come on! This is a test message every 5 seconds!')
                    print(f'Bro, message sent in {channel.name} of {guild.name}')
                except discord.errors.Forbidden:
                    # If the bot doesn't have permission to send messages, skip the channel
                    print(f'No permission to send message in {channel.name} of {guild.name}')
        await asyncio.sleep(5)  # Wait for 5 seconds before sending the next message

# Run the bot with the token
client.run('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE')

Explanation:

Bot Token: Replace 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE' with the token you copied from the Discord Developer Portal.

Message: The bot will send "Bro, come on! This is a test message every 5 seconds!" to every text channel the bot has access to.

Permissions: The bot will skip channels where it doesnâ€™t have permission to send messages (like private channels).

Repeat every 5 seconds: It uses asyncio.sleep(5) to send messages every 5 seconds.


5. Running the Bot

Now, save the script (press Ctrl + X, then Y, and Enter to save) and run it with the following command:

python bro_come_on_bot.py

The bot will log in to Discord and start sending the message every 5 seconds to every text channel in every server it's a member of.

6. Running the Bot Continuously

To ensure the bot keeps running in the background, even if you close Termux, you can use tmux (a terminal multiplexer) to run the bot.

1. Install tmux:

pkg install tmux


2. Start a new tmux session:

tmux


3. Run the bot script inside tmux:

python bro_come_on_bot.py


4. Detach from tmux to let it run in the background: Press Ctrl + B, then D.


5. Reattach to the session to see the bot's output again:

tmux attach-session



7. Permissions and Bot Invite

Make sure your bot has permission to send messages in the channels. When you invite your bot, use the following URL (replacing YOUR_CLIENT_ID with the bot's client ID):

https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&scope=bot&permissions=2048

The permissions=2048 part ensures the bot has the permission to send messages.

Final Thoughts

Once you've followed these steps, your bot will continuously run on Termux and send messages every 5 seconds in all channels. You can modify the message content or the bot's behavior as needed. Let me know if you need any further assistance!
